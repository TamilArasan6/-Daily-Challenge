Question:
The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input. The program must swap the last two digits of X with the last two digits of Y.
Then the program must print their product as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
10 <= X, Y <= 10^4
Input Format:
The first line contains X and Y separated by space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the product as per the given condition.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
34 123
Output:
3082
Explanation:
The last two digits in both integers are swapped to get 23 and 134.
The product of the modified integers is 23 * 134 = 3082
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5323 1295
Output:
6598085
Max Execution Time Limit: 4000 millisecs


code:

import java.util.*;
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int a=sc.nextInt();
		int b=sc.nextInt();
		int s1=a%100;
		int s2=b%100;
		a=a/100;
		b=b/100;
		a*=100;
		b*=100;
		a+=s2;
		b+=s1;
		System.out.print(a*b);
	}
